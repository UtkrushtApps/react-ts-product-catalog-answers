# Solution Steps

1. Define a typed Product interface (src/types/Product.ts) with fields: id, name, price, imageUrl, description.

2. Implement a mock API (src/api/productsApi.ts) that exports an async fetchProducts function returning a delayed list of products, occasionally simulating an error and possible background data change.

3. Create a ProductCard component (src/components/ProductCard.tsx) that accepts a product prop and displays its info. Memoize for render optimization.

4. Create a ProductGrid component (src/components/ProductGrid.tsx) that receives an array of products and renders a ProductCard for each. Memoize the grid component for performance.

5. Add Loading (src/components/Loading.tsx) and Error (src/components/Error.tsx) components for displaying loading and error states, with Error supporting a retry callback.

6. Build a ProductCatalog container component (src/components/ProductCatalog.tsx) that manages fetching logic (loading, error, products), retry mechanism, and background polling for data updates.

7. Use useCallback and useEffect to handle async fetching, background polling, and state updates, with efficient setState to avoid unnecessary re-renders when product data hasn't changed.

8. Use JSON.stringify-based shallow equality in background polling to only update products state if new data differs.

9. In src/App.tsx, render the ProductCatalog; in src/index.tsx, mount App as usual.

10. Create a neat responsive grid UI and design (src/App.css) for mobile and desktop, with clear styles for loading and error states.
